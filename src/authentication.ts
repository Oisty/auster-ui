//TODO figure out how to show sign in error (oops I forgot the sign in page might need to be server side rendered...)
// Sign in is a simple HTML form post to the sign in endpoint. The server sets a cookie and the page refreshes.
// The refresh causes the app to request the current authentication state again. We get the authentication state by
// attempting to fetch the users data which we need to always do anyways. If we get a 401 Unauthenticated response
// we show the sign in form mentioned before.
// The sign out is also just a button in a form post to the sign out endpoint after which the app will start again.
// We don't bother reading the cookie or interpreting its data which should be encrypted anyways.
// The advantage of cookie authentication is that we don't have to do a lot of state management like validating a token.
// It also enables us to put src urls to images that require authentication into img elements because the browser
// automatically attaches the cookie which authorizes the request.

## Contributing

Contributions are absolutely, positively welcome and encouraged! Contributions
come in many forms. You could:

1. Submit a feature request or bug report as an [issue].
2. Ask for improved documentation as an [issue].
3. Comment on [issues that require feedback].
4. Contribute code via [pull requests].

[pull requests]: https://github.com/Oisty/auster-ui/pulls

We aim to keep Auster's code quality at the highest level. This means that any
code you contribute must be:

- **Commented:** Complex and non-obvious functionality must be properly
  commented.
- **Documented:** Public items _must_ have doc comments with examples, if
  applicable.
- **Styled:** Your code's style should match the existing and surrounding code
  style.
- **Simple:** Your code should accomplish its task as simply and
  idiomatically as possible.
- **Tested:** You must write (and pass) convincing tests for any new
  functionality.
- **Focused:** Your code should do what it's supposed to and nothing more.

All pull requests are code reviewed and tested by the CI. Note that unless you
explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted for
inclusion in Auster by you shall be licensed Apache License, Version 2.0,
without any additional terms or conditions.
